# Neh
Back up Unity Package Files for Neh

So far it has 
Player movement, rush, jump, scale and options functioning
- Working Menu Pause system with prefabs
- Health and death with audio and SFX
- Beautiful Minimalist gameplay UI
- Functioning Collectibles and Ranking system
- Input for Keyboard, Gamepad and Joystick although Joystick could be temporary

Lacking
-   Graphics options in menu
-   Home button functionality in Menu
-   No Music at all for now
-   No Main Menu for Now
-   No levels for now but story and dialogues are done

FIXME: The SFX Audio assets need Loudness normalization as some are way louder than other

All in all- its coming along nicelyüòäüëç
